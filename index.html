    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Hi! I'm Max Haberer, and I'm a high school student in Texas!</h3>
    <div class="tile-left">
      <p>
        I just wrapped up the <a href="https://theavr.org/2024" style="color: #e0e0e0">2024 Bell AVR competition</a>
        season, placing 4th at the national championship as a member of team Zephyrus! I was the lead software
        developer, electrical, and mechanical engineer for the AVR drone this year.
        I used Python, C++, PX4, MavLink, and QGroundControl to automate drone movement and task
        execution, including transporting cargo with an imbedded electromagnet and scanning areas of thermal
        activity.
        Some highlights of the season include controlling an electromagnet using a switch on the AVR's remote
        controller, and earning a Judge's Choice award for our autonomous flight capabilities.
        I've learned a lot from this experience and I look forward to educating younger members of the club, preparing
        them to tackle the challenges of next year without me or the other seniors.

        I'm currently applying to college! I hope to major in Electrical & Computer
        Engineering, so that I can focus on my interests in robotics and programming.
